# Plutus Test Question Strategy & Insights

## üìä Test Question Distribution

I've created **100 carefully curated questions** based on extensive research on the most common financial concerns people have. Here's the strategic breakdown:

### Complexity Distribution
- **Simple (34%)**: Basic financial literacy questions that should route to minimal agents
- **Intermediate (48%)**: Multi-factor decisions requiring analysis and comparison
- **Complex (18%)**: Life-changing financial decisions requiring comprehensive analysis

This distribution mirrors real-world usage patterns where most questions are moderate complexity, with a good mix of quick answers and deep analysis needs.

### Top Categories Coverage

| Category | Count | Why It Matters |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Investment** | 32 | #1 concern for wealth building |
| **Retirement** | 24 | Universal long-term concern |
| **Debt Management** | 17 | Major stress point for users |
| **Budgeting** | 16 | Foundation of financial health |
| **Saving** | 15 | Basic wealth accumulation |
| **Tax Planning** | 15 | Optimization opportunity |
| **Risk Management** | 15 | Protection and safety |

## üéØ Strategic Test Scenarios

### 1. **Routing Complexity Tests**

The questions are designed to test different routing paths:

- **Simple Path** (1.5-2s): Emergency fund, basic budgeting
- **Intermediate Path** (2.5-3.5s): Investment choices, debt prioritization
- **Complex Path** (4-6s): Multi-goal optimization, tax strategies

### 2. **Agent Specialization Tests**

Questions specifically designed to test specialized agents:

- **Tax Optimizer**: Roth conversions, inheritance tax, business sales
- **Retirement Planner**: Social Security timing, early retirement feasibility
- **Risk Assessor**: Insurance needs, asset protection, emergency planning
- **Portfolio Manager**: Asset allocation, rebalancing, diversification

### 3. **Real-World Scenario Tests**

Life event-based questions that test comprehensive analysis:

- Having children (questions 49, 68, 73)
- Buying a house (questions 5, 80, 90)
- Career changes (questions 44, 51, 96)
- Retirement transitions (questions 9, 26, 83)
- Inheritance/Windfalls (questions 16, 75, 88)

## üß™ Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Individual Agent Testing
Test each agent type with targeted questions:
```python
simple_questions = [1, 2, 6, 11, 15, 18, 21, 23, 25]  # Basic analyzer
intermediate_questions = [3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 19, 20]  # Multiple agents
complex_questions = [9, 13, 16, 26, 28, 33, 47, 60]     # Full pipeline
```

### Phase 2: Category-Specific Testing
Test domain expertise:
```python
retirement_focused = [4, 9, 13, 14, 20, 26, 28, 36, 41, 47]
investment_focused = [7, 18, 22, 32, 40, 50, 54, 64, 72, 86]
debt_focused = [3, 14, 30, 46, 48, 53, 57, 95]
```

### Phase 3: Performance Testing
Measure response times by complexity:
- Simple questions: Target < 2 seconds
- Intermediate questions: Target < 3 seconds
- Complex questions: Target < 5 seconds

### Phase 4: Accuracy Testing
Verify quality of responses:
- Financial calculations accuracy
- Tax implications correctness
- Risk assessment appropriateness
- Recommendation relevance

## üîç Key Insights from Question Analysis

### 1. **Most Common User Concerns**
Based on research, the top concerns are:
1. "Can I afford to retire?" (questions 9, 26, 41, 47, 83)
2. "Should I pay off debt or invest?" (questions 3, 14, 30, 48, 95)
3. "How much house can I afford?" (questions 5, 80, 90)
4. "Am I saving enough?" (questions 2, 23, 41, 76)
5. "How do I minimize taxes?" (questions 16, 28, 42, 58, 75)

### 2. **Complexity Triggers**
Questions become complex when they involve:
- Multiple time horizons (near-term vs long-term)
- Tax implications
- Life transitions (marriage, divorce, children, retirement)
- Large sums of money (>$50,000)
- Multiple competing goals

### 3. **Agent Collaboration Patterns**
Common agent combinations:
- **Financial + Risk**: For major purchases
- **Tax + Investment**: For optimization strategies
- **Retirement + Estate**: For wealth transfer
- **Debt + Investment**: For prioritization decisions

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### Success Metrics
1. **Coverage**: All 20 categories tested
2. **Performance**: 90% of questions answered within target time
3. **Accuracy**: Financial calculations within 1% margin
4. **Relevance**: Recommendations align with user context
5. **Routing**: Correct complexity classification 95% of the time

### Edge Cases to Monitor
- Questions with conflicting goals (save vs spend)

- Time-sensitive decisions (stock options, refinancing)
- High-stakes decisions (business sale, divorce, inheritance)

## üöÄ Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Simple Questions**: Build confidence in basic routing
2. **Progress to Intermediate**: Test agent collaboration
3. **Challenge with Complex**: Verify comprehensive analysis
4. **Run Category Batches**: Ensure domain expertise
5. **Stress Test with Edge Cases**: Verify robust handling
